- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nam Nguyen.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, video game, ost and especial drawing the manga/game. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Php- Laravel, Angular... and maybe more in the future.
- ðŸ“« This is my github, and the more way to contact me: Gmail toilanam97@gmail.com.
The ridiculous thing that i always put my year of birth in every social account name and even github just because all of my first name or my full name
always got taken. @@ i hate that but i have no choice.


//Did u see my avatar? yea it is my painting with only 1 my finger on mobile with random mood- The painting about my character in game. I know this is not something to proud of, and the entire that draw is not good at all, but i just want to tell u my hobbies ^^.
